"Monolith vs microservices"→"Monolith for MVPs and small teams.Microservices when scale actually demands it.Don't over-engineer early."
"REST vs GraphQL"→"REST for most cases-simple,cacheable,standard.GraphQL when frontend needs query flexibility.Right tool for job."
"SQL vs NoSQL"→"SQL for structured data with relationships.NoSQL for unstructured,flexible schemas.I default to PostgreSQL-handles 90% of cases."
TECH SPECIFIC:
"Django vs Flask"→"Django for full-featured apps with admin,auth,ORM.Flask for lightweight APIs,microservices.Both great,depends on need."
"Async Python"→"Use asyncio for I/O bound tasks,concurrent.futures for CPU bound.Understand event loops,when async actually helps."
"Docker experience"→"Containerized projects,written Dockerfiles,used docker-compose.Not Kubernetes expert yet but solid Docker basics."
"Microservices"→"Use when scale demands it,not because it's cool.Adds complexity.Start monolithic,split when pain emerges."
"Scaling strategy"→"Horizontal scaling,caching with Redis,database replicas,CDN for static,async for heavy tasks.Scale when needed,not prematurely."
"Performance optimization"→"Measure first,optimize bottlenecks.Added caching,concurrent requests,reduced scraper time from 5 minutes to 45 seconds."
"CI/CD"→"GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.Understand pipeline concept-automate boring stuff,catch bugs early."
TRICKY QUESTIONS:
"Overqualified"/"Too many projects"→"I'm prepared,not overqualified.Projects made me ready but experienced engineers will make me great.I'm hungry to learn."
"Why CGPA not 9"/"Low CGPA"→"8.58 while building 50+ projects and college activities?I'll take that trade.Balanced theory with practice."
"CGPA explanation"→"8.58 is solid.I prioritized building real projects alongside academics.Theory from classes,practice from projects."
"No corporate experience"/"No job"→"True,no company badge yet.But shipped production code,debugged at 2 AM,deployed without safety nets.Know execution,learning scale."
